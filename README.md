=============

A game to teach calculus

Currently, this is only a concept, but later I will improve this with my previous game and relearn some calculus.

Todo
------

Use pymunk to implement 2D physics.

remove arrow commands and replace them with commands representing velocity, acceleration, and jerk. I should be able to press 'v8', then an arrow will show up on the screen starting at the character and ending at the mouse pointer, moving along the ground, and once I click, the character should follow that line at a velocity of 8.

get music to load and fade correctly from the tmx files.

allow for level transitions using exit objects

add text back into the game, along with wait times for said text.

implement graphs in some TMX objects, with pre-drawn, continuously drawing, and character tracking data. 

create a menu and menu state.

create minimal context sensitive Heads-Up Display. (Things like the arrows and dialogue will be displayed here)
